# Circuit_design_EcoG_signal

Electrocorticogram (ECoG) is an electrophysiological signal that results from the summation of neuronal activity near the cortical surface. To record ECoG signals, the scalp and skull are surgically opened and electrodes are placed on the cortical surface, either epidurally or subdurally.

Designed a circuit using second order high pass filter, instrumentation amplifier (INA 128), second order low pass filter and a second order notch filter (Twin-T notch filter).
